"""Provenance stamping for ingested DataFrames (downloaded files or webscrapes).

Every DataFrame produced by ingestion carries a fixed set of **provenance** columns,
appended after its source columns, so a datalake's bronze layer is self-describing and
drift-detectable: given a stored row you can answer *where it came from*, *how stale it is*,
*which dataset and package version produced it*, and *whether the source artifact changed*.

The seam is deliberately split so it composes with the raw-artifact-persistence pattern:

- :func:`hash_artifact` — the **I/O half**: streams a file's bytes into a ``sha256`` digest.
  The reader (which holds the downloaded file) calls this *inside* its temp-workspace block,
  before the workspace is torn down.
- :func:`stamp_provenance` — the **pure half**: a frame transform with no I/O. It takes the
  already-computed content hash (and the package version) as arguments, so a reader that
  finishes building its frame *after* the workspace closes (e.g. a post-extraction merge) can
  still stamp it. The one non-determinism — a per-call ``ingestion_run_id`` UUID shared by
  every row of one read — is generated here.

The column *names* live on :class:`utils.tabular_reader.FileContract`
(``PROVENANCE_COLUMNS``) so the contract describes the full output shape
(``output_columns``); they are not in ``tuple_required`` (that validates the source artifact,
which lacks them), so stamping happens **after** contract validation. Text provenance columns
use the nullable ``string`` dtype, consistent with the dtypes lesson; ``updated_at`` is
**tz-aware UTC** (lossless, unambiguous) — a sink that cannot store tz-aware timestamps
normalises at the warehouse load boundary, never here and never via a per-reader flag.

Enforcement: ``bin/check_provenance.py`` (wired into both ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` and
``.github/workflows/tests.yaml``) asserts that every ``src/`` module referencing ``read_table``
also references ``stamp_provenance`` — so a contract-checked read cannot ship without a stamp.
