"""Editable runtime type-checking **policy** for the beartype-backed engine.

This module externalises the *tunable* decisions that the ``validate`` adapter (the thin
beartype wrapper alongside it) applies, so a project can adjust the policy **without editing
engine internals**. beartype has no file-based config (no TOML/INI loader); its
configuration is a :class:`~beartype.BeartypeConf` built in code — this module is that
code, isolated and documented so the knobs are discoverable and safe to change.

Flip a knob below and the engine's runtime behaviour changes on the next import — nothing
in ``validate.py`` needs to change.

Knobs
-----
VIOLATION_TYPE : ⚠ **LOAD-BEARING — do not change lightly.**
    beartype's own ``BeartypeCallHintParamViolation`` is *not* a ``TypeError`` subclass.
    The scaffolded projects — and every ``pytest.raises(TypeError)`` in their tests, plus
    any caller catching ``TypeError`` — depend on violations being ``TypeError``. Keep this
    ``TypeError`` unless you are prepared to migrate every consumer.
STRICT_BOOL : bool
    PEP 484 makes ``bool`` a subtype of ``int``, so a stray ``True`` silently counts as
    ``1``. When ``True`` (default) the ``int`` hint is overridden to reject ``bool``, and
    the override reaches inside generics such as ``list[int]``. Set ``False`` to accept
    PEP 484's default.
WIDEN_INT_TO_NUMPY : bool
    When ``True`` (default) and NumPy is installed, the ``int`` hint also admits
    ``numpy.integer`` so a NumPy scalar satisfies an ``int`` annotation. Silently ignored
    on the leaner tiers that ship without NumPy.
PEP484_NUMERIC_TOWER : bool
    beartype's ``is_pep484_tower``. When ``True``, an ``int`` annotation also accepts
    ``float``/``complex`` and a ``float`` annotation accepts ``complex`` (PEP 484's numeric
    tower). ``False`` by default — the project prefers exact numeric types. A natural
    opt-in knob.
