"""Reference behavioural port — copy this per real macro-section operation, then delete it.

In hexagonal *ports-and-adapters* terms this ABC is a **port**: it pins the single operation
that a family of concrete classes (the *adapters*) all implement, so callers can treat any
adapter polymorphically and every new variant conforms to the same shape. It is private
(``_internal``): consumers import the concrete adapters, never this port.

The port is generic over ``T`` (the value it operates on) so an adapter narrows the type
through the type parameter — e.g. ``class CsvHandler(ExamplePort[pd.DataFrame])`` — rather than
by re-annotating the override, keeping the concrete signature Liskov-compatible. ``T`` is
unbounded here; bind it (``TypeVar("T", bound=BaseModel)``) when every adapter shares a base.
