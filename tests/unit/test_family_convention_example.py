"""Worked example: enforce a family-wide convention with an introspective test.

When every member of a family (readers, adapters, handlers, commands) must
declare something — a class attribute, a registration, a config knob — do **not**
rely on prose in a doc or on copy-paste discipline. Ship a test that *discovers*
the family from the public API (``__all__``) and asserts the convention on each
member, so a new member that skips it fails CI automatically, without anyone
updating the test.

This module is a **template**. In a real project, replace the illustrative
``_Reader`` family below with an import of your package
(``import myproj.section as family``) whose ``__all__`` is the API surface, and
assert your real convention. Delete this file if the project has no such family.

Key points, each a trap avoided:

* **Discover, never hand-list** the members — a hand-listed tuple of *classes*
  rots the moment someone adds a member, the exact failure this test prevents.
  Derive them from the declared name surface (``__all__``).
* **Add the meta-test** that the discovery itself is non-empty and matches the
  declared surface, so the per-member test can never silently cover nothing.
* **Assert on class/constructor state**, so no I/O or mocking is needed.
