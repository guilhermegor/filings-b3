"""Weekly, non-gating drift check: does each shipped contract still match its live source?

The second half of the oracle discipline (`config/CLAUDE.md` → "Pin every contract to a
source-published oracle"). A pinned fixture proves the contract matched **the day it was written**;
only re-fetching the live source can catch the source changing it *afterwards*. This driver does
exactly that — and **never fails**. It compares each contract's columns against the current header
and reports drift; the surrounding workflow turns a report into an *issue*, never a red check.

Why never fail: a network test contradicts the socket-blocking `conftest` guard, "the source is
down" and "our contract is wrong" are indistinguishable as a failed check, and an external host on
a gating path has silently skipped a release before. So this always exits 0 — it is a *reporter*,
not a gate. It **self-skips to success** when `config/contract_oracles.yaml` lists no sources.

Run online only (it is wired into the scheduled `contract_drift.yaml` workflow, never into PR/push
CI). Reads the registry, re-fetches each source's header through the one `http_downloader` seam,
writes a Markdown report to ``contract_drift_report.md`` (empty when there is no drift), and prints
a summary.

    The two directions are **not** symmetric:

    - **A required column vanished from the source is ALWAYS drift** — the read would raise.
    - **"the source has a column the contract doesn't list" is drift ONLY when the contract
      claims completeness** (``bool_full_column``). ``tuple_required`` means "must contain at
      least these", so a deliberate *subset* contract (require the keys, let the rest flow
      through) legitimately omits most columns; flagging them reports every non-required column
      as a finding. A job that cries wolf on its first run is worse than no job.

    A fetch failure is **not** drift either (the source may be down, or the artifact for the
    current period may not be published yet), so it becomes a *note* — logged for the operator,
    kept out of the report that opens an issue.
